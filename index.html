                Bill became a member of the Galena Volunteer Fire Department in 1956 and continued his membership for the next 64 years holding positions of Secretary, Assistant Chief and since 1985 serving as Galena’s Fire Chief. Bill’s dedication to the department was an extension of his love of his hometown, Galena. Bill’s desire was always to make things “bigger and better” and demonstrated that by his tireless work constantly upgrading equipment and training the men and women of the department whom he loved like his own family. Bill’s passion for Galena Day’s, an annual birthday celebration for the town of Galena, helped not only to promote Galena but to generate funds for the addition and improvement of equipment for the fire department. Bill served as the master of ceremonies for the celebration for 40 years and worked to provide a fun and entertainment for all to enjoy. Bill was an active participant of the Fire Chief’s Association and was proud of the camaraderie that the area fire departments shared. Bill lived by his motto “Make a Difference”.  This Motto can now be seen on all of Galena Fire Departments vehicles.

        The founding purpose of this Fund was to honor Mr. Bill Hall for his life time of indelible memories and influence that he has made with thousands of people across many States. His leadership, the wisdom he shared, his incredible memory, his unique sense of humor, and his sincere caring and consideration of others and above all a person of excellent morals.
        The legal purpose of this Fund is to support Galena area citizens by monetarily aiding public, civic and private projects. We believe that Bill would certainly approve of this however he would probably prefer not to have his name involved.
